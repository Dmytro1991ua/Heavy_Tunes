As a huge fan of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal and to be totally honest with any offshoot of those styles of music, I have been inspired to create a simple version of some sort of iTunes app but related to heavy music. 

***Heavy__Tunes*** is a light version of iTunes which basically dedicated to the music of Gods, which is Hard Rock and Heavy Metal by the way. The project includes a custom video, audio, and radio players. 


Stack of technologies which were used to develop a particular project: 
#### HTML/HTML5, CSS3, BEM, JS, Responsive Web Design, Mobile First Approach.
